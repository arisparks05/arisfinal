<h1 style="color: grey;">SOPHMORE OIL WORKS by me Ariana Sparks</h1>
<div class="Art"> The works that will be displayed are art peices that were made in my 
	oil painting class i took this semester. Oil painting is a new medium to me
	and this would help keep track of what i've done in the class. 
The specific peices posted are the ones i enjoyed working on the most.</div>
